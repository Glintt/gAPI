I'm glad you're reading this as we need volunteer developers to help improve this project.

#### Did you find a bug?

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security issue**
* **Make sure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under issues.
* **Be sure to include a title and description on the new issue**. The title and description must contain as much relevant information as possible , a code sample and a test case demonstrating the expected that is not happening. 

#### Did you implement new features or changed already existing one?

* Send a [GitHub Pull Request to gAPIManagement](https://github.com/Glintt/gAPIManagement/compare) with a clear list of all features you've done.
* Make sure all your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
* Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line message is fine for small changes. For bigger changes, you should add a more detailed message.
